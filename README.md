# KubeVirt Charts

**WIP**  
**Charts not yet published until automated publisher is ready**

While waiting for [official ones](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/8347) I've created simple app that auto creates the Charts on each
KubeVirt release.

Currently handles:

- KubeVirt (CRDs separated out to dedicated Chart)
- KubeVirt CDI (CRDs separated out to dedicated Chart)

# Usage

```bash
TODO 
```
